# WalkerThreads-TP-FSPD
This is a C/C++ programming project that implements a movement control and synchronization system for multiple threads operating on an NxN grid (board).

This was a pratical work needed for the Foundations of Parallel and Distributed Systems subject of my science computer course at Federal University of Minas Gerais.
